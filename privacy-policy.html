          <h4>Cookies, Tracking and Ad Networks</h4>
          <p>We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site or Services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you
            <br>
            <br><strong>Cookies</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to manage how websites place cookies through your browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.
            <br>
            <br>Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site and App to, among other things, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.
            <br>
            <br>Third Party Analytics. We use automated devices and applications, such as&nbsp;Google Analytics&nbsp;(opt-out info&nbsp;here) and&nbsp;Mix Panel&nbsp;(opt out info&nbsp;here) to evaluate usage of our Site and App.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services; we do not share your personal information with these third parties.&nbsp;
            <br>
            <br><strong>Targeted Advertising and Ad Networks.</strong>&nbsp;We may send users targeted ads, based on their location and activities within the Services (on the Site and in the App).&nbsp;&nbsp;We may also participate in third party ad networks and allow third parties to use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies on the Site and App to collect usage information and display targeted ads. For example, we may use Google’s&nbsp;Ad Mob&nbsp;to help us display targeted ads in the App.&nbsp;&nbsp;These third parties may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources.
            <br>
            <br><strong>Do-Not-Track.</strong>&nbsp;Our Site does not honor browser do-not-track requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, you can find information on how to opt out of many online ad networks at the following sites:&nbsp;Network Advertising Initiative, and&nbsp;Digital Advertising Alliance. Please note that opting out does not prevent ads from being displayed to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, if you delete cookies after opting out, your opt out may no longer be effective.</p>
          <h4>User Generated Content</h4>
          <p>We invite you to post content, including recommendations, comments, pictures, and other information that you would like to share through the Services. This content is shared with other users, business partners and other third parties. Your postings may become public and Wadju cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your privacy.</p>
          <h4>Third-Party Links</h4>
          <p>Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.</p>
          <h4>Security of My Personal Information</h4>
          <p>We have implemented measures to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.</p>
          <h4>Access To My Personal Information</h4>
          <p>You may modify some of the information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your profile information and review history. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site or Application for a period of time, and we will retain a copy of this information in our systems.</p>
          <h4>What Choices Do I Have?</h4>
          <p>We give you the following choices about your information and content:
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Emails</strong>.&nbsp;We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail. It may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you e-mails about your account or any Services you have requested or received from us.
            <br>
            <br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Privacy Settings.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The default setting for your recommendations and other content is public, meaning it can be viewed by others; however, you can choose to set your recommendations and other content to private.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, please note that if you set your content to private, your name and profile picture will still be viewable to other users.</p>
          <h4>Children Under 13</h4>
          <p>Our Services are not designed for children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our systems.</p>
